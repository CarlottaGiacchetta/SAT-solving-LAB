;You want to unlock the mobilephone of your friend to see if they
;are dating someone. Sadly, there is a 2*2 grid pattern lock that
;stops you. You remember that the password requires all 4 pins to
;be connected; moreover, there are no diagonal lines in the pattern,
;the order of pins is important and we cannot choose the same pin
;twice (i.e. we cannot have a loop). How many combinations do you
;have to try in the worst case to unlock the sphone?
